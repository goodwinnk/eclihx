# CTP version #

**The community preview version of the EclihX IDE is available for downloading.**

This version contains the basic necessary features for working with haXe projects. I have prepared a new archive with the version and "How to start" tutorial. Both files are available in **Downloads** section.

## Requirements ##

  * Windows
  * Eclipse SDK 3.4 Ganymede
  * JRE 1.6

This version will work only on Windows. In more details, some features of course may work on other platforms, but I just had no time for testing anywhere else. Launching and content assistant won't work for sure.

The other thing I should mention is that I decided to disable debugger for this version. The reason is lack of time too. Sorry. So this release is aimed to support the features that must be done in IDE. That's why it's only a CTP. EclihX now contains only a base for a future development.

That's all, now please try :)
